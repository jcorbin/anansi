# AnANSI - a bag of collected wisdom for manipulating terminals

... or yet ANother ANSI terminal library.

## Why?

- Designed to be a loosely coupled set of principled layers, rather than (just)
  one unified convenient interface
- Be more Go-idiomatic / natural: e.g.  [ansi.DecodeEscape][ansi_decode_escape]
  following [utf8.DecodeRune][decode_rune] convention, rather than heavier
  weight event parsing/handling
- Supporting use cases other than fullscreen raw mode
- Allow applications to choose input modality, rather than lock-in to one
  paradigm like non-blocking/SIGIO
- Support implementing terminal emulators, e.g. to build a multiplexer or debug
  wrapper

## Status

**Experimental**: AnANSI is currently in initial exploration mode, and while
things on master are reasonably stable, there's no guarantees yet.

### Demos

The [Decode Demo Command][decode_demo] demonstrates ansi Decoding, optionally
with mouse reporting and terminal state manipulation (for raw and alternate
screen mode). When run in batch mode (on a regular file rather than a
terminal), it replaces ansi escape sequences with `[ansi ...]` representation
strings; there is also a `-strip` flag, to simply strip all escape sequences
from a file.

The [Palette Demo Command][palette_demo] demonstrates the various ansi color
spaces, and optionally some vendor standard color themes.

There's also a [lolwut][lolwut] demo, which is a port of antirez's,
demonstrating braille-bitmap rendering capability. It has an optional
interactive animated mode of which demonstrates the experimental `x/platform`
layer.

There's another `x/platform` [demo][demo] that draws a colorful test pattern.

### Done

Experimental cohesive [`x/platform`][platform_pkg] layer:
- provides a `platform.Events` queue layered on top of `anansi.input`, which
  contains parsed `rune`, `ansi.Escape`, and `ansi.MouseState` data
- synthesizes all of the below `anansi` pieces (`Term`, `Input`, `Output`, etc)
  into one cohesive `platform.Context` which supports a single combined round
  of non-blocking input processing and output generation
- provides signal handling for typical things like `SIGINT`, `SIGERM`,
  `SIGHUP`, and `SIGWINCH`
- drives a `platform.Client` in a `platform.Tick` loop at a desired
  Frames-Per-Second (FPS) rate
- provides input record and replay on top of (de)serialized client and platform
  state
- supports inter-frame background work
- provides a diagnostic HUD overlay that displays things like Go's `log`
  output, FPS, time, mouse state, screen size, etc

Toplevel [`anansi`][anansi_pkg] package:
- [`anansi.Term`][anansi_term], [`anansi.Context`][anansi_context],
  [`anansi.Attr`][anansi_attr], and [`anansi.Mode`][anansi_mode] provide
  cohesive management of terminal state such as raw mode, ANSI escape sequenced
  modes, and SGR attribute state
- [`anansi.Input`][anansi_input] supports reading input from a file handle,
  implementing both blocking `.ReadMore()` and non-blocking `.ReadAny()` modes
- [`anansi.Output`][anansi_output] mediates flushing output from any
  `io.WriterTo` (implemented by both `anansi.Cursor` and `anansi.Screen`) into
  a file handle.  It properly handles non-blocking IO (by temporarily doing a
  blocking write if necessary) to coexist with `anansi.Input` (since `stdin`
  and `stdout` share the same underlying file descriptor)
- [`anansi.Cursor`][anansi_cursor] represents cursor state including position,
  visibility, and SGR attribute(s); it supports processing under an
  [`anansi.Buffer`][anansi_buffer]
- [`anansi.Grid`][anansi_grid] provides a 2d array of `rune` and`ansi.SGRAttr`
  data; it supports processing under an [`anansi.Buffer`][anansi_buffer].
- [`anansi.Screen`][anansi_screen] combines an `anansi.Cursor` with
  `anansi.Grid`, supporting differential screen updates and final post-update
  cursor display
- [`anansi.Bitmap`][anansi_bitmap] provides a 2d bitmap that can be rendered or
  drawn into braille runes.
- Both `anansi.Grid` and `anansi.Bitmap` support `anansi.Style`d
  [render][anansi_render_grid]ing into an `anansi.Buffer`, or
  [draw][anansi_draw_grid]ing into an (other) `anansi.Grid`.
- [`anansi.Buffer`][anansi_buffer] supports deferred writing to a terminal; the
  primary trick that it adds beyond a basic `bytes.Buffer` convenience, is
  allowing the users to process escape sequences, no matter how they're
  written. This enables keeping virtual state (such as cursor position or a
  cell grid) up to date without locking downstream users into specific APIs for
  writing

Core [`anansi/ansi`][ansi_pkg] package:
- [`ansi.DecodeEscape`][ansi_decode_escape] provides escape sequence decoding
  as similarly to [`utf8.DecodeRune`][decode_rune] as possible. Additional
  support for decoding escape arguments is provided (`DecodeNumber`,
  `DecodeSGR`, `DecodeMode`, and `DecodeCursorCardinal`)
- [`ansi.SGRAttr`][ansi_sgr] supports dealing with terminal colors and text
  attributes
- [`ansi.MouseState`][ansi_mousestate] supports handling xterm extended mouse
  reporting
- function definitions like [`ansi.CUP`][ansi_cup] and [`ansi.SM`][ansi_sm] for
  building [`control sequences`][ansi_seq] terminal state management
- [`ansi.Mode`][ansi_mode] supports setting and clearing various modes such as
  mouse reporting (and its optional extra levels like motion and full button
  reporting)
- [`ansi.Point`][ansi_point] and [`ansi.Rectangle`][ansi_rectangle] support
  sane handling of 1,1-originated screen geometry

### Errata

- differential screen update is still not perfect, although the glitches that
  were previously present are now lessened due to the functional test; however
  this was done by removing a (perhaps premature) cursor movement optimization
  to simplify diffing
- Works For Me â„¢ in tmux-under-iTerm2: should also work in other modern
  xterm-descended terminals, such as the libvte family; however terminfo
  detection not yet used by the platform layer, so basic things like
  smcup/rmcup inversion may by broken
- `anansi.Screen` doesn't (yet) implement full vt100 emulation, notably lacking
  is scrolling region support
- there's something glitchy with trying to write into the final cell (last
  column of last row), sometimes it seems to trigger a scroll (as when used by
  hud log view) sometimes not (as when background filled by demo)

### WIP

- an [experimental mid-tier anui package](../../tree/dev/anui) architected
  around a stack of cooperative layers with user-interaction-authority over
  each other provides a re-usable fullscreen run loop for many application
  cases.
- an [interact command demo](../../tree/dev/cmd/interact/main.go) which
  allows you to interactively manipulate arguments passed to a dynamically
  executed command

### TODO

- fancier image rendition (e.g. leveraging iTerm2's image support)
- special decoding for CSI M, whose arg follows AFTER
- provide `DecodeEscapeInString(s string)` for completeness
- support bracketed paste mode (and decoding pastes from it)
- consider compacting the record file format; maybe also compression it
- terminfo layer:
  - automated codegen (for builtins)
  - full load rather than the termbox-inherited cherry picking
- terminal interrogation:
  - where's the cursor?
  - CSI DA
  - CSI DSR

### Branches

AnANSI uses a triple branch (`master`, `rc`, and `dev`) pattern that I've found
useful:
- the [master branch][master] has relatively stable code but is
  still pre `v1.0.0`, and so is not *actually* stable; tests must pass on all
  commits. NOTE any package under `anansi/x/` doesn't even have the tacit
  attempt made at stability that the rest of `anansi/` on master does.
- the [rc branch][rc] contains code that is stable-ish: tests should
  pass on all commits
- the [dev branch][dev] contains the sum of all hopes/fears, tests
  may not pass
- the [import branch](../../tree/import) contains prior code inherited from
  [execs reboot][import] that's in the process of being
  reprised through the dev branch
